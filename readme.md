# Spring PetClinic Sample Application using spring-graphql

This PetClinic version uses the new [spring-graphql](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-graphql) project, that has been [introduced](https://spring.io/blog/2021/07/06/hello-spring-graphql) in july 2021
and is going to be shipped with Spring Boot 2.7.

This version currenty uses **Spring Boot 2.7 M3** with **GraphQL for Spring 1.0.0-M6**.

It implements a [GraphQL API](http://graphql.org/) for the PetClinic and
provides an example Frontend for the API.

## Features

As spring-graphql is still experimental, this PetClinic is experimental and in-progress too.

Some features that are built in:

* [Annotated Controllers](https://docs.spring.io/spring-graphql/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/#controllers) (see `SpecialtyController` and `VetController`)
* Subscriptions via Websockets (see `VisitController#onNewVisit`)  
* Own scalar types (See `PetClinicRuntimeWiringConfiguration` and `DateCoercing`)
* GraphQL Interfaces (GraphQL Type `Person`) and Unions (GraphQL Type `AddVetPayload`), see class `PetClinicRuntimeWiringConfiguration`
* Security: the `/graphql` http and WebSocket endpoints are secured and can only be accessed using a JWT token. More fine grained security is implemented using `@PreAuthorize` (see `VetService`)
  * Example: Â´addVet` mutation is only allowed for users with `ROLE_MANAGER` 
* Pagination and Sorting of results: implemented with `spring-data`, see `OwnerQueryWiring`
* Tests: See `test` folder for typical GraphQL endpoint tests, including tests for security

# Running the sample application

You can run the sample application with two ways:

1. The easiest way: run it pre-configured in cloud IDE [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
2. Run it locally

## Run it in GitPod

To run the application (backend, GraphiQL and React frontend) in GitPod, simply click on the "Open in GitPod" button at the top of this README.

- Note that you need a (free) GitPod account.
- And please make sure that you allow your browser opening new tabs/windows from gitpod.io!

After clicking on the GitPod button, GitPod creates a new workspace including an Editor for you, builds the application and starts
backend and frontend. That might take some time!

When backend and frontend are running, GitPod opens two new browser tabs, one with GraphiQL and one with the
PetClinic backend. For login options, see below "Accessing the GraphQL API"

Note that the workspace is your personal workspace, you can make changes, save files, re-open the workspace at any
time and you can even create git commits and pull requests from it. For more information see GitPod documentation.

In the GitPod editor you can make changes to the app, and after saving the app will be recompiled and redeployed automatically.

## Running locally

The server is implemented in the `backend` folder and can be started either from your IDE (`org.springframework.samples.petclinic.PetClinicApplication`) or
using maven from the root folder of the repository:

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl backend
```

Note: the server runs on port **9977**, so make sure, this port is available.

(The server uses an in-memory database, so no external DB is needed)



## Running the frontend

While you can access the whole GraphQL API from GraphiQL this demo application also
contains a modified version of the classic PetClinic UI. Compared to the original
client this client is built as a Single-Page-Application using **React** and **Apollo GraphQL**
and has slightly different features to make it a more realistic use-case for GraphQL.

You can install and start the frontend by using npm:

```
cd ./frontend

npm install

npm run build:css

npm run generate

npm start
```

The running frontend can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

For valid users to login, see list above.

# Accessing the GraphQL API

You can access the GraphQL API via the included customized version of GraphiQL.

The included GraphiQL adds support for login to the original GraphiQL.

You can use the following users for login:

* **joe/joe**: Regular user
* **susi/susi**: has Manager Role and is allowed to execute the `createVet` Mutation

After starting the server, GraphiQL runs on [http://localhost:9977](http://localhost:9977)

**Note**: The WebSocket/Subscription support in GraphiQL is far from being robust. Use with care!
